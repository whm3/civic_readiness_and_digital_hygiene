This is a *really* good fit for what you’re doing—and also a useful contrast piece. I’ll keep this **high-level, non-fanboy, and curriculum-aligned**, per your ask.

## How **“Advice to Would-Be Heroes”** Works as Doctrine

**Advice to Would-be Heroes**
 from **Oathbound** (lead vocal: **Leslie Fish**)

### Core Theme (Plain Language)

**Heroics are loud, fragile, and short-lived. Survival, care, and competence last.**

This song is not anti-courage; it’s **anti-romance**. It systematically dismantles the fantasy of heroic action and replaces it with:

- logistics
- humility
- maintenance
- collective survival
- exit planning

Which puts it *squarely* in alignment with your project’s **anti-spectacle, pro-continuity** posture.

------

## Lesson Plan (Quick, High-Level)

### Lesson Title

**Advice to Would-Be Heroes**
 *(Competence over glory)*

### Module Placement

**Sustainability, Restraint & Long-Game Participation**

### Lesson Purpose

To teach that:

- competence matters more than valor
- survival is an ethical obligation
- “hero” behavior is often irresponsible
- care for people, animals, tools, and self is the real work

This lesson reframes **not burning out** and **not getting killed** as moral achievements—not personal failures.

------

### Core Doctrine (Mnemonic-Level)

**Heroes burn bright. Professionals last.**

------

### Key Concepts (Compressed)

#### 1. **Logistics Beat Glory**

- Food before praise
- Sleep before speeches
- Maintenance before performance

👉 *If you can’t sustain yourself, you can’t help anyone.*

This mirrors:

- **Allowed to Rest**
- **After the Sirens**
- **Archive, Not Outrage**

------

#### 2. **Skill Is Quiet**

- Don’t boast
- Don’t posture
- Don’t assume you’re the best in the room

👉 *Competence doesn’t need witnesses.*

Direct alignment with:

- **Say It Slow**
- **Walk Like You Belong**
- **Confidence Is Camouflage**

------

#### 3. **Leaders Who Seek Heroes Get People Killed**

- Good captains plan redundancies
- They listen
- They avoid priests and hype merchants
- They choose steady people over flashy ones

👉 *Hero selection is a failure mode.*

This dovetails cleanly with:

- **Big Tent Weather**
- **Carry the Signal**
- **Escalation Is a Tell**

------

#### 4. **Survival Requires Exit Planning**

- Old swords don’t get hired
- Bodies age
- You need a second trade
- The work ends eventually

👉 *The ethical actor plans for life after the moment.*

This maps directly to:

- **Allowed to Leave**
- **If It Breaks, Walk Away**
- **After the Sirens**

------

#### 5. **Care Is the Through-Line**

- Care for animals
- Care for tools
- Care for teammates
- Care for yourself

👉 *Care is the unglamorous work that keeps everyone alive.*

Which is the same moral engine as:

- **Come Be Part of It**
- **No One Goes Alone**
- **Stay Upright**

------

## What This Song Does *Differently* Than Your Project

This is important.

**Advice to Would-Be Heroes**:

- accepts violence as a given (fantasy context)
- normalizes risk as inevitable
- frames restraint as survival wisdom

Your project:

- removes violence from the frame entirely
- treats escalation as a diagnostic failure
- frames restraint as ethical legitimacy

👉 **The overlap is in \*behavior\*, not worldview.**

That’s fine—and actually useful.

------

## How It Fits the Larger Project (Summary)

**Yes, it applies—and it strengthens your arc if positioned correctly.**

### Best Framing

Use it as:

> *“An older cultural warning against heroic thinking—updated here for civic life.”*

### Why It Belongs

- It reinforces **anti-martyrdom**
- It undermines **ego-driven participation**
- It validates **quiet competence**
- It normalizes **leaving, aging, and rotating out**

### Caution

Don’t lean into:

- romantic danger
- “necessary violence”
- elite warrior identity

Treat it as:

> **A folk cautionary tale about burnout, logistics, and hubris.**

------

## One-Sentence Integration Hook

**Heroics feel good. Continuity gets people home.**

If you want, next we can:

- adapt this into a **civilian-safe lesson tile**
- extract a **“non-hero doctrine”** that cleanly fits your voice
- or explicitly contrast it with **Come Be Part of It** as a tonal bridge

You’re doing very careful, very grown-up work here—and this song actually helps underline that.
