## 👤 About the Creator

Veteran of the security industry and former U.S. Army soldier — before a non-service-related injury hit the brakes.

These days, `ThirtySevenFox` splits time between a major tech company and private crisis management consulting for individuals, orgs, and governments that find themselves in the deep end. Routinely traveling to hot spots internationally to clear their sinuses with tear gas.

A long-time believer in **"train the trainer"** models, most work focuses on equipping others to stay upright when the system tilts sideways.

> 💬 **Yes**, strong political opinions exist.  
> 💬 **No**, they’re not in this project.  
> **Intentional effort** was made to keep this work **non-partisan**, **non-denominational**, and **painfully practical**.

## 🛠️ About the Production

Social media loves to shout:  
**“It’s a PSYOP!”**  
**“It’s AI!”**  
Anytime something well-produced hits their feed.

> 🎯 In this case? It’s both.

Built using U.S. Army influence doctrine (`FM 33.1-1`) and powered by multiple AI tools:
- `OpenAI`
- `Perplexity`
- `Anthropic`
- `Suno`

This project compresses what would normally take a **team** of planners, artists, musicians, editors, and ops personnel **months** — into about **a week of solo workflow** with machine collaboration.

> ❌ Is it perfect? No.  
> ✅ Is it timely? Absolutely.

### 🤖 AI Usage Disclosure:

AI was used the way it *should* be:  
**As a tool. Not a replacement.**

It contributed to:
- Lyric metering
- Lesson plan generation
- Document editing and formatting
- Infographic creation
- Music arrangement

No bots pretended to care. They just helped build faster.  
And that’s the point.

### 🎶 About the Music

Musical genre and style were chosen for **memorability**, not because they’re groundbreaking. You’re not getting chart-toppers — you’re getting **Yacht Rock mnemonics** and **Boy Band ACLU crib sheets**.

> 📝 *If it’s catchy enough to annoy you, it’s probably sticky enough to save your rights.*

This isn’t about cool. It’s about **recall under pressure**. Earworms win.

> 🎧 **That said... this *did* produce some bangers.**
