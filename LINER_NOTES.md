## 👤 About the Creator

Veteran of the security industry and former U.S. Army soldier — before a catastrophic, non-service-related injury hit the brakes.

These days, `ThirtySevenFox` splits time between a major tech company and private crisis management consulting for individuals, orgs, and governments that find themselves in the deep end.

A long-time believer in **"train the trainer"** models, most work focuses on equipping others to stay upright when the system tilts sideways.

> 💬 **Yes**, strong political opinions exist.  
> 💬 **No**, they’re not in this project.  
> **Intentional effort** was made to keep this work **non-partisan**, **non-denominational**, and **painfully practical**.

## 🛠️ About the Production

Social media loves to shout:  
**“It’s a PSYOP!”**  
**“It’s AI!”**  
Anytime something well-produced hits their feed.

> 🎯 In this case? It’s both.

Built using U.S. Army influence doctrine (`FM 33.1-1`) and powered by multiple AI tools:
- `OpenAI`
- `Perplexity`
- `Anthropic`
- `Suno`

This project compresses what would normally take a **team** of planners, artists, musicians, editors, and ops personnel **months** — into about **a week of solo workflow** with machine collaboration.

> ❌ Is it perfect? No.  
> ✅ Is it timely? Absolutely.

### 🤖 AI Usage Disclosure:

AI was used the way it *should* be:  
**As a tool. Not a replacement.**

It contributed to:
- Lyric metering
- Lesson plan generation
- Document editing and formatting
- Infographic creation
- Music arrangement

No bots pretended to care. They just helped build faster.  
And that’s the point.
