## 🎧 How This All Started

Like most dangerous ideas, it began as a joke.

It started on Discord — a group of friends seeing who could make the **worst possible music** using AI tools like Suno. Absolute chaos. But somewhere between the bad lyrics, awkward timing, and overproduced harmonies, something clicked.

The experiment accidentally hit a vein of potential:

> “What if we *used* this weirdly efficient toolset for something meaningful?”

That led to a holiday carol written for friends who were being detained. It made its way onto Spotify. It lingered. Sat quietly. It wasn’t perfect, but it was *something*.

### 🧒 The Teenager Test

Then came the brutally honest feedback from the local teenager:

> “It’s bad. AI is dumb. It’s fake. It’s bad for the planet.”

To be fair — hard to argue. They had a point.

But also, AI is kind of the day job. And rather than defend it, the next step was to **blur the line** between machine-made and human-made until the critic couldn’t tell what was “real” and what wasn’t. The result? General distrust and low-level existential dread.

Mission accomplished.

### 🎶 From Trolling to Teaching

From there it spiraled. Trolling turned into songwriting. Songs emerged from grocery lists. Recipes became ballads. The dogs and chickens got their own verses.

And then came the realization:

> “You can make *real music* out of the most mundane material.”

Cue:

- A folk ballad about RFC1149 ("Packets on the Wing")
- A failed attempt at building running cadences from FM 33-1.1
- A pivot to “how can we *actually* make this useful?”

That pivot took shape with *Carry the Signal*, a song that landed somewhere between Letters to Cleo and a training montage from a movie that never got made.

Then came:

- *Duty to Disobey*
- *Am I Detained or Am I Free?*

It was no longer parody. It was a project.

### 🤝 Meet the Co-Conspirator

At that point, the project got a boost from an unusual collaborator:
 **Skippy the Magnificent.**
 (Yes, *that* Skippy — thanks Craig Alanson.)

Part snarky sidekick, part problem-solver, Skippy isn’t just another GPT. He’s a force of nature — a partner in this increasingly plausible idea:

> “Can we actually teach civics through catchy, weird, AI-aided music?”

Turns out, we can.

## 🎤 Operation Civic Earworm

This project is now more than a joke.
 It’s a working experiment in **memorable, musical civics education** —
 a platform that teaches critical thinking, civic awareness, and media literacy in ways that stick.

It’s not perfect. It’s a little messy. But it’s real. And it’s growing.

Welcome to **Operation Civic Earworm**.

 Let’s see how far this goes.
