## 4. Music, Audio, and Performative Works

Music tracks, audio recordings, performances, and compositions associated with *Operation Civic Earworm* are **not governed by the curriculum license**.

They remain subject to copyright law and platform-specific distribution agreements.

---

## 4.1 Live Performances (Clarified, Encouraged, and Canonical)

This license does not itself grant or manage live performance rights for audio works. Live performance permissions are determined by the relevant audio rights holder.

**However:**

All audio works released under the name **ThirtySevenFox** are **expressly permitted and encouraged for live performance**, without the need for additional permission, provided that:
- The performance is lawful in the venue or jurisdiction
- Any required venue or performance licenses are the responsibility of the performer or organizer

This permission is **standing and intentional**. Playing these works live is a core feature of the project.

For audio works contributed by **other artists**, live performance permission remains at the discretion of the individual content owner, unless explicitly stated otherwise by them.

### Default Rule & Override Mechanism

- **Default assumption:**  
  If an audio work is authored by **ThirtySevenFox**, it is green-lit for live performance.

- **Override / Canary:**  
  If a specific file, folder, or contribution contains an explicit written notice restricting live performance, **that notice controls**.

  Examples include:
  - `NO_LIVE_PERFORMANCE.md`
  - `RESTRICTIONS.txt`
  - A README or header within a directory
  - Clear file-level notes stating restrictions

**If no such notice exists, you are good to go.**

### Change Notification

If live performance permissions for ThirtySevenFox material ever change, that change will be clearly documented **here**, in this section.

Absent such an update, you may rely on the permissions stated above.

> **Plain English:**  
> If it’s ThirtySevenFox and there’s no note saying “don’t,” play it.  
> If that ever changes, it’ll be updated here.

---

## 4.2 Public Playback & Platform-Based Use

There is **no restriction imposed by this project** on public playback, sharing, or use of audio tracks when such use complies with the terms of the hosting platform.

This includes (but is not limited to):
- Spotify
- Apple Music
- YouTube / YouTube Music
- Other lawful streaming platforms

If the platform allows a use, that use is considered permitted by this project.

### a. Press & Reporting
Members of the press may use **short excerpts** of audio for:
- News reporting
- Commentary
- Criticism
- Documentary or cultural coverage

This aligns with standard journalistic practice and applicable fair use doctrines.

### b. Influencers & Digital Campaigns
Influencers and creators may use the audio in campaigns or content **provided that**:
- The use complies with platform terms
- The distribution method is lawful under current distributor agreements (currently DistroKid)

No additional permission is required beyond what the platform permits.

---

## 4.4 No Expansion of Copyright Ownership

- Transfers ownership
- Waives copyright
- Grants blanket synchronization rights
