# If It Breaks, Walk Away

### Verse 1

Someone's pushing faster now
Says we gotta do it loud
Says this chance won't come again
Says delay means we all bend

Every sentence hits a shove
Every plan needs just a nudge
Keeps on turning up the heat
Calls it truth calls it belief

### Pre-Chorus

If it needs you scared
It's not your move

### Chorus

*If it breaks
Walk away
If it rushes
Don't obey
You don't fix
What wants to fail
You stay clean
You disengage*

*If it cracks
Let it fall
You don't need
To save it all
If it pulls you off your ground
That's your cue
You're out*

---

### Verse 2 *(infiltration via talk & probing)*

Someone in your circle leans
Trading stories they shouldn't mean
Asks too much and shares too wide
Turns small talk into a slide

Wants the names wants the plans
Wants to know who understands
Calls it trust calls it care
But leaves fingerprints in the air

### Pre-Chorus

If it needs a push
It's not for you

### Chorus

*If it breaks
Walk away
If it shouts
Lower pace
You don't prove
You don't explain
You step back
You disengage*

*If it burns
Let it burn
You don't have
To take your turn
If it feeds on getting loud
That's your sign
You're out*

---

### Bridge *(half-time ska drop)*

No call-out
No debate
No "who are you"
No take the bait

You don't point
You don't stay
You don't argue
You walk away

---

### Verse 3

Real work moves a little slow
Leaves no mark for you to show
Doesn't need a scene or spark
Doesn't tear itself apart

If it's solid it will hold
If it's right it won't be sold
If it's real it won't demand
That you cross a breaking line

---

### Final Chorus

*If it breaks
Walk away
If it pulls
Don't engage
You don't win
By standing loud
You win
By getting out*

*If it needs you to go down
To make its point
It's not sound
If it can't stay clean and calm
That's your cue
Move on*

---

### Outro

**If it needed you to stay
It wouldn't ask you to break.**
