CARRY THE SIGNAL
  ThirtySevenFox


[Intro (spoken / half-sung)


Yeah…
Know the ground before you run.

Verse 1 – Know the Ground

Before you scream into the night
You read the room, you read the light
Who’s out there watchin’, who believes
What keeps ‘em strong, what makes ‘em bleed
You don’t just fire, you don’t just shout
You dial it in, you sort it out

(Drums lock in, guitar chugs tighten)

Pre-Chorus

You don’t waste a word in the dark
You strike the nerve, you hit the mark

Chorus (Gang Vocals)

Carry the signal — steady and true
One clear message — cuttin’ right through
Not every ear, not every mind
Right words, right place, right time
Carry the signal — loud but clean
Say it once… then say it again

Verse 2 – One Purpose, One Aim

A thousand slogans hit the floor
If they don’t know what they’re fightin’ for
Every line, every flame
Points straight dead-center at the aim
If it don’t push the plan ahead
Leave it unsaid, leave it dead

Pre-Chorus

No distractions, no disguise
One hard truth in a thousand eyes

Chorus

Carry the signal — don’t confuse
Cut the clutter, sharpen the truth
If you drift, you’ll lose control
Discipline keeps it rock-and-roll
Carry the signal — night to day
Same damn meaning, new damn way

Verse 3 – Credibility Is Currency

You don’t buy trust, you build it slow
Brick by brick, you let it show
Once it cracks, it don’t repair
No cheap spin gets you outta there
Truth runs farther than the lie
And it don’t fade when the years roll by

Pre-Chorus

If they doubt you, count it done
You lost the war before it’s won

Chorus

Carry the signal — honest and raw
No false promise, no hidden claw
If they smell fear, you’re already through
The message dies before it moves
Carry the signal — stand and be seen
Built to take the heat, built to be clean

Verse 4 – Repetition Without Noise

You don’t repeat to dull the sound
You repeat to drive it down
Same old fire, new disguise
Burns the same behind the eyes
Consistency — that’s how it stays
Chaos fades, the signal stays

Chorus

Carry the signal — again and again
Different streets, different men
Not louder — just crystal clear
Till the meaning lands and sticks right here
Carry the signal — don’t overload
Less said strong carries the load

Bridge – Ethics & Restraint (Breakdown, half-time stomp)

Power without a line will rot
Everything you think you’ve got
When you forget the human cost
You win the fight but lose it all



Final Chorus (Key Change, Full Arena)

Carry the signal — plan it tight
Audience first, target in sight
Credibility, clarity, review
Cut what’s false, keep what’s true
Carry the signal — end to end
From first intent… to final amend

Outro (Chanted, boots on gravel)

It ain’t the volume
It ain’t the spin
It’s knowin’ the why
And knowin’ who’s in

(Crunch—crunch—crunch—crunch)
Know the people.
Know the plan.
Carry the signal.
Stand your ground.
