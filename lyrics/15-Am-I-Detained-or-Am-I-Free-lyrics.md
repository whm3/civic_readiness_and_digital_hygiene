Am I detained or am I Free?

(“Ask, Silent, Lawyer”)

(A protester’s legal-reality training song)


Verse 1 – The Stop

You’re holding a sign, standing your ground
Sirens hum, boots on the ground
A voice cuts through the crowd tonight
“Step over here”—don’t rush, don’t fight

Take a breath, slow your pace
Hands in sight, neutral face
First words matter, keep it clean
There’s one key question in between

Pre-Chorus – The First Rule

Don’t guess, don’t argue, don’t explain
One calm line cuts through the strain

Chorus – The Hook (Mnemonic Core)

🎶 Am I detained, or am I free?
If I’m not, I’ll go peacefully
If I am, I stay silent now
I want a lawyer, that’s allowed
No consent, no extra talk
Ask. Silent. Lawyer. Walk. 🎶

(Repeatable chant section in live training)

Verse 2 – Detention vs Arrest

Detained’s not jail, but it’s not a chat
They’re checking facts, that’s where you’re at
You don’t have to help them guess
Silence isn’t guilt, it’s finesse

They might push, they might plead
“Just tell us”—don’t take the bait you don’t need
Names and dates may be required
But stories light the fuse they wire

Pre-Chorus – The Trap

Friendly tone, a casual line
That’s how they blur your rights with time

Chorus – The Hook (Reinforced)

🎶 Am I detained, or am I free?
If I’m not, I’ll go peacefully
If I am, I stay silent now
I want a lawyer, that’s allowed
No consent, no extra talk
Ask. Silent. Lawyer. Walk. 🎶

Verse 3 – Search & Seizure

They ask to look inside your bag
Your phone, your pockets, what you have
You can say no—say it clear
That’s not resistance, that’s your shield

They might search you anyway
Don’t interfere, don’t escalate
Say the words so records show
“I do not consent”—then let it go

Bridge – The Reality Check

They can arrest you even right
When laws are vague or temps are high
Charges stack, then fall apart
Later—on paper—not on the start

The win is getting home alive
With your rights intact to fight
Street’s not court, don’t try the case
You win by leaving with your face

Breakdown – Spoken (Training Callout)

(Half-time, spoken over drums)

You don’t argue law on the curb

You don’t explain your innocence

You don’t unlock your phone

You don’t consent

You do stay calm

You do stay silent

You do ask for a lawyer

Final Chorus – Locked In

🎶 Am I detained, or am I free?
That one question covers me
If I’m held, I don’t resist
Silence is my legal fist
No consent, no extra talk
Ask. Silent. Lawyer. Walk. 🎶

Outro – Whisper / Fade

Ask the question.
Say the words.
Go home safe.
Protect the movement.
