# Love, Power, War

### Intro *(spoken, rhythmic)*

Listen close—this tale's not old,
But the rules it tells are made of gold.
War's not just steel or soldier's might,
It's also thought, and moral right.

---

### Verse 1

War's not a game, it's center stage,
Where politics burns in a fiercer rage.
Fire of anger, the move of the mind—
Three forces dancing, all entwined.

A sword may strike, but the brain must guide,
Darkness ends where aims collide.
Victory needs more than just a roar—
Without a reason, it's just a score.

### Pre-Chorus

It's not just war, it's not just words,
It's power aligned with changing worlds.
Forget your goal? Then lose your way—
And empty hands are all that stay.

### Chorus

*War is politics — just turned up high.
Love, power, war — they share the sky.
Will speaks loud, strength replies,
Victory's only where meaning lies.*

*War is politics — don't forget this truth:
No goal? Then there's no win for you.*

---

### Verse 2

Plans are perfect — on the page.
But battle bends them in a cage.
Dust and noise, the hidden twist—
Fog of war means much is missed.

What looked straight now turns wild,
One small flaw, chaos compiled.
Friction, friend, is not a bug—
It's the reason nothing fits snug.

---

### Dance Break

### Verse 3

Find the heart, where power lives,
Strike it there — and the whole thing gives.
Army? People? Morale, belief?
Break the core, you break the chief.

Don't waste punches in the air,
Precision lands the greater scare.
If you hit the center clean,
You change the course — unseen.

### Pre-Chorus 2

More power means more control,
But push too far, and cracks take hold.
Push too fast and you may break—
Clausewitz warned: there's much at stake.

### Chorus – Reprise

*War is politics — turned up loud.
Dreams, might, and truth — make it proud.
Use of force is still an art—
Without clear goals, it falls apart.*

*War is politics — remember it right.
With clear intent, you'll win that fight.*

---

### Bridge

Guns don't march alone to war—
Faith and fear move armies more.
Hearts that falter lose the line,
But hearts that burn will rise and shine.

---

### Final Chorus

*War is politics — so understand,
Power needs a careful hand.
Keep your fire beneath your aim,
Or victory's just a different name.*

*Clausewitz warned—don't miss the part:
Without clear thought, strength falls apart.*

---

### Outro *(soft, reflective)*

Wars may end, but thought goes on.
Victory's earned when wisdom's strong.
Not all who fight have truly won.
**The mind must guide…
When the war is done.**
