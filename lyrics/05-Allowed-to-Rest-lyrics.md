# Allowed to Rest

### Intro *(spoken, soft)*

You don't have to be everywhere.
You don't have to hold every line.

*(vinyl crackle, beat drops)*

---

### Verse 1

Notifications blink all night
Like the world won't wait
If you close your eyes
But nothing true disappears
When you disappear for a while

### Hook *(repeated, melodic)*

*You're allowed to rest
You're allowed to rest*

---

### Verse 2

Everyone looks strong online
Wide awake, unbent
But anything that never bends
Eventually breaks

You don't have to prove
That you still care
By being tired all the time

### Hook *(repeat)*

*You're allowed to rest
You're allowed to rest*

---

### Bridge *(spoken, filtered)*

Drink some water.
Turn it off.
Leave it unfinished.
That's not a flaw.

Someone else is here tonight.
You're not gone.
You're just offline.

---

### Verse 3

The work is patient
It waits
The fire doesn't die
It changes shape

You don't owe the future
Every breath you've got
It needs you whole
Not wrung out

---

### Final Hook *(loop-friendly)*

*You're allowed to rest
You're allowed to rest
You're allowed to rest*

---

### Outro *(fade)*

Put it down.
Come back later.
**You still belong.**
