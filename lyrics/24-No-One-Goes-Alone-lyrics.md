# No One Goes Alone

### Verse 1

Lights fade down the street gets thin
Crowd moves on but some stay in
Phones are low voices too
Nothing left to shout or prove

Names get called doors close fast
Hours feel longer than the past
No one cheers no banners wave
Just the work that follows the brave

### Pre-Chorus

When the noise is gone
We're still here

### Chorus *(big, stacked, communal)*

*No one goes alone
Not tonight
Not like this
We stay till it's done
We don't disappear
We don't run*

*No one goes alone
Through the cold
Through the wait
Every step
Every gate
No one goes alone*

---

### Verse 2

Someone's counting minutes down
Someone found a place to sit
Someone's got a charger out
Someone knows the number list

Water passed no questions asked
Jackets traded quiet and fast
No posts no photos no display
Just making sure you're okay

### Pre-Chorus

This is where
We hold the line

### Chorus

*No one goes alone
Not tonight
Not like this
We stay till it's done
We don't disappear
We don't run*

*No one goes alone
Through the cold
Through the wait
Every step
Every gate
No one goes alone*

---

### Bridge *(drop instruments, voices layer in)*

Waiting is the work
Staying is the act
Showing up again
That's how trust comes back

No speeches
No signs
Just time
And light

---

### Verse 3

Doors open names are read
Someone's walking someone home
Nothing viral nothing said
Just the road you shouldn't roam

Court dates written calm and slow
Rides arranged before you go
Tomorrow's heavy but tonight
You're not facing it alone

---

### Final Chorus *(full band, fullest stack)*

*No one goes alone
Hear it clear
Say it plain
If you're here
We remain*

*No one goes alone
Through the doubt
Through the wait
Every name
Every state
No one goes alone*

---

### Outro *(voices only)*

**No one goes alone.**
