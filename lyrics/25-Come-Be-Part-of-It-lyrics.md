### Verse 1

They say history's something you watch
From the back of the room, behind the glass
Like it happens somewhere else
Like it's already in the past

But you're here with your feet on the ground
With a heartbeat, with a sound
This moment isn't far away
It's calling out your name right now

### Pre-Chorus

You don't need a spotlight
You don't need a plan
You just show up
Take someone's hand

### Chorus

*Don't just watch it happen, come be part of it
Say it out loud, yeah your voice matters
This is our country, you belong in it
We don't let our people disappear*

---

### Verse 2

It's not owned by the loudest voice
Or the ones who never change
It's built by all the little choices
We make every day

By checking in, by staying late
By remembering names and faces
By standing close when things feel thin
By making room in crowded spaces

### Pre-Chorus

You don't have to lead the way
You don't have to know it all
If you care, you're already
Standing tall

### Chorus

*Don't just watch it happen, come be part of it
Say it out loud, yeah your voice matters
This is our country, you belong in it
We don't let our people disappear*

---

### Bridge

If someone's missing, we say their name
If someone's hurting, we don't look away
They took our friends, we won't forget
We won't let silence bury that

They tried to erase them, close the door
So we sing louder than before
We stay connected, we stand our ground
We leave no one unaccounted now

The strongest thing you'll ever do
Is show up calm and see it through

---

### Breakdown

This is how it moves
This is how it stays
Not in silence
Not in shade

---

### Final Chorus

*Don't just watch it happen, come be part of it
Sing it out loud, yeah your voice matters
This is our country, you belong in it
Together we don't disappear*

---

### Outro

They took our friends
They took our friends
But they're not gone from us tonight

You're not alone, we all can help
We make this country by ourselves
Stand up, stay kind, don't disappear
**Let's be part of history, together.**
