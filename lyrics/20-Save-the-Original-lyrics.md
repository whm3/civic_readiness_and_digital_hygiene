# Save the Original

### Verse 1

Phones come out before the thought
Everyone's a witness now
Thumbs move faster than the truth
Once it's gone, you can't undo

Clips feel clean, but context slips
Time gets lost in little bits
What you post feels right tonight
But tomorrow reads it twice

### Pre-Chorus

Screens are loud, records are calm
One survives when noise is gone

### Chorus

*Save the original, keep it whole
Don't remix what you don't control
Silence isn't giving in
It's how the long game gets to win*

*Save the file, name the date
What you keep decides the weight
Posts disappear, records persist
Save the original, resist*

---

### Verse 2

Screenshots crop the edges off
Metadata tells it all
Who was there and when it moved
That's the part the courts will use

Clouds feel safe till they're not
Shared too fast, too widely caught
Attention fades, but copies stay
In places you can't walk away

### Pre-Chorus

Likes don't help when facts are thin
Truth needs room to settle in

### Chorus

*Save the original, keep it whole
Don't explain it, don't editorialize
Silence isn't giving in
It's how the long game gets to win*

*Save the file, write it clean
Names, times, what you've seen
Posts disappear, records persist
Save the original, resist*

### Bridge *(spoken / half-sung)*

Don't post tired.
Don't post mad.
Sleep on it.
Check the facts.

Keep the copy.
Keep it safe.
Tomorrow needs
What you save.

---

### Verse 3

Justice doesn't scroll or trend
It reads slow, from start to end
What survives is what was true
Before the edits ran it through

You don't owe the feed your proof
You don't win by oversharing truth
The strongest move is knowing when
To say nothing—and save it then

---

### Final Chorus

*Save the original, keep it whole
Let the record do its role
Silence isn't giving in
It's how the long game gets to win*

*Save the file, hold your ground
Truth gets louder when it's sound
Posts disappear, records persist
Save the original, resist*

---

### Outro

Keep it clean.
Keep it safe.
**What you save
Shapes the case.**
