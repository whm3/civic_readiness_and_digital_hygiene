# Make the Phone Boring

### Verse 1 — Framing

Phones are smart
But not your spine
Not the place
For every line

If it thinks
So you don't have to
That's when it
Starts choosing for you

Before the door
Before the sound
Decide what comes
Along around

### Pre-Chorus

If it does more
Than it needs to do
That's one more thing
Controlling you

### Chorus — Core Rule

*Make the phone boring
Make it plain
No little glow
Calling your name*

*If it doesn't help
Leave it behind
Quiet is a kind
Of mind*

*Make the phone boring
Lock it down
Nothing to see
Nothing around*

*You're not hiding
You're just clean
You don't owe
Every screen*

---

### Verse 2 — Device Separation

One phone carries
Your whole life
Every habit
Every night

That one stays home
That one stays known
It doesn't need
To walk this road

Another phone
For showing up
No past to pull
No life to touch

It knows today
And not before
That's all it's for
That's all it's for

### Pre-Chorus 2

When lives mix
Risk spreads wide
Clean lines
Keep sides inside

### Chorus — Reinforced

*Make the phone boring
Make it small
One job only
Nothing more*

*What you live
Stays where you are
What you bring
Doesn't know your heart*

---

### Verse 3 — Sync & Exhaust

Every tap
Goes somewhere else
Copies made
You never felt

Clouds don't ask
If now's the time
They just keep
Every line

Even still
It talks away
Logging things
You didn't say

The less it knows
The less it sends
Silence travels
Farther then

---

### Verse 4 — Input Risk

Even trusted apps
Sit on keys
Guess your words
Before you mean

Hands move fast
The screen remembers
More than just
What you enter

If it matters
Say it slow
Or ask if
It needs to go

---

### Verse 5 — Cables & Power

Outlet hums
By the wall
Cables offered
Like a call

Waiting rooms
Airport rows
Power that
You don't quite know

If you didn't
Bring the wire
Don't accept
The borrowed fire

Some things charge
More than a phone
Some things shouldn't
Touch your own

---

### Bridge — Silence & Refusal

Power talks
Even when you don't
Silence means
You said no

Later works
Just as well
Nothing breaks
If you don't plug in

---

### Verse 6 — Biometrics

Fingers answer
Faster than thought
Faces open
What words would not

Speed feels easy
Till it's not
Memory waits
Muscle won't

If it opens
Just by being you
That's one thing
You didn't choose

Let it ask
Let it wait
Slow is still
A kind of gate

---

### Verse 7 — Memory

Phones are smart
But not your ground
They can die
Or not be found

Numbers worth
Your peace of mind
Live in you
Not all online

Say them through
Write them once
Legal help
Knows how to find you

Memory's the backup
You control
When the screen
Won't play its role

---

### Verse 8 — Aftercare

When you're home
And lights are low
There's still some care
You need to show

Change the locks
You can't see
Close the doors
Quietly

Nothing rushed
Nothing loud
Just clean it up
When you're allowed

---

### Final Chorus — Lock-In

*Make the phone boring
Before you go
The less it does
The more you know*

*If it mattered
You would know
If it didn't
Let it go*

*Make the phone boring
Black and still
Nothing arguing
With your will*

*You're not hiding
You're not wrong
You're just keeping
Lines strong*

---

### Outro — Mantra

Before the street
Before the sound
Make the quiet
Stick around

**Make it boring.**
