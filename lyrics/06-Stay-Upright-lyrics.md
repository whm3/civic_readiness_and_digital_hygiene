Stay Upright
  -ThirtySevenFox

Before the chant, before the shout,
Read the bodies, reed the doubt
Feet too close, shoulders tight,
Breth gets short when space gets light
Noise goes sharp, the rhythm breaks,
That’s when panic starts to wake
Crowds don’t think, they surge and bend,
So you slow it down before the end
You don’t win by pushing through,
You win by keeping people true
Chorus – 
🎶 Stay upright, stay aware
Hands down low, give people air
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast
Get folks home—make it last
No sharp turns, no sudden fear
De-escalate—keep people here 🎶
If voices rise, you drop your tone,
Calm is contagious when it’s shown
Face turned sideways, palms in view,
You model what you want them to do
You don’t corner, you don’t crowd,
You don’t argue with the loud
You name the moment, plain and slow:
“We’re safe. We’ve got room. We can go.”
As one old lesson still comes through:
“Nonviolence is a powerful and just weapon.”
So you wield it when the tension’s new
Chorus – (Repeat)
🎶 Stay upright, stay aware
Hands down low, give people air
🎶 Stay upright, stay aware
Hands down low, give people air
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast
Get folks home—make it last
No sharp turns, no sudden fear
De-escalate—keep people here 🎶
Some folks push to spark the flame,
They want the crowd to lose its name
You don’t shame, you don’t engage,
You widen space, you slow the rage
You pull aside who’s feeling spun,
One calm voice beats ten that run
You break the surge, you break the chain,
You don’t let chaos choose the lane
“The means determine the end.”
So don’t let fear decide your bend
”
So don’t let fear decide your bend
“I raise my voice—not so I can shout, but so that those without a voice can be heard.”
So lower yours—let the message be heard
Watch the exits.
Don’t block the flow.
If someone falls—stop and go slow.
Arms linked low, not chest to chest.
Safety first. The rest is rest.
Verse 4 – When It’s Time to Leave
Winning sometimes means you go,
Before the pressure starts to grow
A clean exit is a quiet win,
No one hurt, no chaos in
You don’t need the final word,
You need every person heard
History remembers who stayed whole,
Not who lost control
🎶 Stay upright, stay aware
Hands down low, give people air
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast
Get folks home—make it last
No sharp turns, no sudden fear
De-escalate—keep people here 🎶
Outro – Spoken, Calm
Courage isn’t noise.
Control is care.
The crowd is people.
Treat them that way.
