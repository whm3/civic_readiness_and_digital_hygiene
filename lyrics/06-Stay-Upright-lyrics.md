# Stay Upright

### Verse 1

Before the chant, before the shout
Read the bodies, read the doubt
Feet too close, shoulders tight
Breath gets short when space gets light

Noise goes sharp, the rhythm breaks
That's when panic starts to wake
Crowds don't think, they surge and bend
So you slow it down before the end

You don't win by pushing through
You win by keeping people true

### Chorus

*Stay upright, stay aware
Hands down low, give people air
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast
Get folks home — make it last*

*No sharp turns, no sudden fear
De-escalate — keep people here*

---

### Verse 2

If voices rise, you drop your tone
Calm is contagious when it's shown
Face turned sideways, palms in view
You model what you want them to do

You don't corner, you don't crowd
You don't argue with the loud
You name the moment, plain and slow:
"We're safe. We've got room. We can go."

As one old lesson still comes through:
*"Nonviolence is a powerful and just weapon."*
So you wield it when the tension's new

### Chorus *(Repeat)*

*Stay upright, stay aware
Hands down low, give people air
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast
Get folks home — make it last*

*No sharp turns, no sudden fear
De-escalate — keep people here*

---

### Verse 3

Some folks push to spark the flame
They want the crowd to lose its name
You don't shame, you don't engage
You widen space, you slow the rage

You pull aside who's feeling spun
One calm voice beats ten that run
You break the surge, you break the chain
You don't let chaos choose the lane

*"The means determine the end."*
So don't let fear decide your bend

*"I raise my voice — not so I can shout, but so that those without a voice can be heard."*
So lower yours — let the message be heard

---

### Breakdown

Watch the exits.
Don't block the flow.
If someone falls — stop and go slow.
Arms linked low, not chest to chest.
Safety first. The rest is rest.

---

### Verse 4 — When It's Time to Leave

Winning sometimes means you go
Before the pressure starts to grow
A clean exit is a quiet win
No one hurt, no chaos in

You don't need the final word
You need every person heard
History remembers who stayed whole
Not who lost control

### Final Chorus

*Stay upright, stay aware
Hands down low, give people air
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast
Get folks home — make it last*

*No sharp turns, no sudden fear
De-escalate — keep people here*

---

### Outro *(Spoken, Calm)*

Courage isn't noise.
Control is care.
The crowd is people.
**Treat them that way.**
