When It’s Needed
  -ThirtySevenFox

Verse 1

Crowd gets close and voices rise
Space feels thin in people’s eyes
Nothing calls no orders sent
Still everyone feels the moment bend

Someone watching the edges wide
Feels the shift before it slides
Someone slowing the crowd with care
Lower hands and open air

Pre-Chorus

You don’t become someone new
You do what you already do

Chorus

Know what you’re good at
Play to your strengths
Do what fits
And then it ends
No title
No trace
No one keeps
The place

When it’s needed
That’s the cue
Do what’s natural
Then you’re through

Verse 2

Someone patches those who go down
Steady hands no noise no crown
If you heal you already know
Hands stay calm and pace stays slow

Someone notes the time and place
What was seen not what was faced
Words stay clean the record stays
Facts don’t drift the way stories sway

Pre-Chorus

If it turns into a badge
It already went bad

Chorus

Know what you’re good at
Play to your strengths
Do what fits
And then it ends
No leader
No claim
No one owns
The name

When it’s needed
Then it’s gone
Nothing carries
Nothing on

Bridge (half-time, smooth)

Someone helps people leave
Not as one not as three
Left or right a quiet word
Everyone goes home unheard

You don’t train
You don’t pose
You don’t act
You already know

Verse 3

Someone watching the edges still
Sees when pressure starts to build
Someone slowing the crowd again
Keeps it human keeps it plain

Someone patches those who go down
Someone notes what happened where
Someone helps people leave the frame
No one stays to take the name

Final Chorus

Know what you’re good at
Nothing more
When it’s done
There’s no encore
You don’t lead
You don’t explain
You help once
Then disengage

Know what you’re good at
Play it clean
Do your part
Then leave the scene

Outro

If you can’t tell
Who did what
It worked
