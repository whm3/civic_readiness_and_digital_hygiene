### Verse 1 — The Rule

Sidewalk heartbeat, city lights
Standing peaceful, standing right
You can guide the flow tonight
But you don't get my words inside

Public space, that's where we stand
Freedom's not by government hand
You can manage crowds with care
But you don't choose what's in the air

### Pre-Chorus *(Mnemonic Drop)*

*Time, Place, Manner — say it slow
How we speak, not what we know*

### Chorus

*You can tell me when
You can tell me where
You can say "keep moving,"
Say "lower the air"
But you can't touch the message
Can't silence me
Time, Place, and Manner, baby
Not my voice — TPM*

---

### Verse 2 — Permits

If it's large and loud and blocking lanes
Yeah, paperwork might join the game
But a sign, a chant, a moment's spark
Don't need a stamp to leave a mark

*(L-A-P-S — remember the sign)*
Large crowds, amps, parades in line
Sidewalk speech, spontaneous
That's protected — serious

### Pre-Chorus 2

*Rules gotta fit, rules gotta stay
Same for me and you, every day*

### Chorus *(Repeat)*

*You can tell me when
You can tell me where
You can manage movement,
Keep the streets fair
But you can't pick sides
Or rewrite me
Time, Place, and Manner, baby
Not my voice — TPM*

---

### Bridge — Observers / Filming *(Mnemonic Core)*

*F-I-L-M — we're standing free
Public place, lawfully
Camera steady, hands in sight
Document the truth tonight*

*S-A-F-E — that's how we stay
Don't interfere, don't block the way
Lawful orders, calm and clear
Witness work — we're still right here*

---

### Break *(Call-Out Style, Very 90s)*

Say it!
FILM SAFE!
Say it!
TPM!

---

### Final Chorus *(Key Change)*

*You can guide the crowd
Keep the peace tonight
But you don't get to dim
The First Amendment light
We observe, record, peacefully
Time, Place, and Manner, baby
But freedom stays with me*

---

### Outro *(Soft, Harmonic Fade)*

Film safe… stand clear…
**Rights don't disappear.**
