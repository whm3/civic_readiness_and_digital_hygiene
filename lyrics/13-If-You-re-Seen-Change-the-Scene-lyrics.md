If You're Seen, Change the Scene
  -ThirtySevenFox

Verse 1 – The Mindset

Before you leave the house, slow down your feet
Look up from the phone, read the street
Most folks rush, eyes locked ahead
But watchers love the unaware and led

You don’t need paranoia, fear, or dread
Just curiosity instead
Ask one thing, simple and plain:
“Does what I see make sense again?”

Chorus – The Hook

🎶
If you’re seen, change the scene
If they follow, break the routine
Left then right, stop then go
Watch who speeds up, watch who slows

You don’t run, you don’t flee
You observe… deliberately
If you feel the thread between
If you’re seen — change the scene
🎶

Verse 2 – Baseline Behavior

Every place has a natural flow
Commuters rush, then ebb, then go
Who waits where no one waits?
Who mirrors pace instead of fate?

Learn the baseline, what’s “normal” there
Who blends in and who doesn’t care
One wrong note in a quiet song
Is how you tell when something’s wrong

Verse 3 – Surveillance Detection Routes

Take a path you wouldn’t need
A coffee stop you didn’t seed
Cross the street, then cross back twice
Normal folks won’t pay that price

Enter shops, then exit fast
Pause to tie a shoe, let moments pass
Those with purpose drift away
Those with eyes decide to stay

Chorus – Variation

🎶
If you’re seen, change the scene
Don’t confront, don’t intervene
You don’t stare, you don’t glare
You just notice who is there

Patterns break when pressure’s applied
Followers hate the zigzag ride
If you feel the thread between
If you’re seen — change the scene
🎶

Verse 4 – Watching the Watchers

Reflections tell you more than eyes
Glass and chrome don’t ever lie
Windows, mirrors, parked car sheen
Reveal what’s hiding just off-screen

Don’t look back, just look through
Angles do the work for you
Shadows stretch and footsteps rhyme
That’s not coincidence—it’s time

Verse 5 – Staying Unobserved

Blend with purpose, not disguise
Act like you belong, be wise
Confidence is camouflage
Hesitation draws the eyes

No sudden stops, no panicked turns
Calm is something watchers learn
If you must move, move with grace
Stillness is a faster pace

Bridge – The Rule of Three

🎶
Once is chance, twice is strange
Three times means the rules have changed
Faces, cars, or colored coats
Recurring like familiar notes

Don’t accuse, don’t assume
Just adjust and widen room
Distance is your best routine
Space breaks every tracking scheme
🎶

Verse 6 – Breaking Contact

Crowds are shields, doors are tools
Escalators change the rules
Public places, open light
Reduce advantage, raise the price

If they’re smart, they’ll disengage
When the risk outweighs the stage
That’s success—you never know
Who quit the dance and let you go

Final Chorus – Full Reprise

🎶
If you’re seen, change the scene
Keep it quiet, keep it clean
Observe the world, don’t play the role
Awareness is how you stay whole

You don’t chase, you don’t fight
You just sharpen up your sight
Walk your path, calm and keen
If you’re seen — change the scene
🎶

Outro – The Lesson

Most days pass without a test
Awareness still is worth the rest
The goal’s not fear, it’s clarity
Seeing more so you stay free

You don’t vanish, you don’t hide
You walk awake, eyes open wide
And that’s the skill, simple, clean:
If you’re seen… change the scene.
