SALUTE
  -ThirtySevenFox

Verse 1 – Setting the Scene

Sun’s on the pavement, time’s slipping by
Crowd keeps moving, nobody asks why
You don’t jump to answers, you don’t overplay
You just watch it unfold the professional way

You’re not here to headline
You’re not here to assume
You catch what’s real in the moment
Before it drifts out of view

Pre-Chorus

No drama, no guesses
No heat in your tone
Just facts in a clean line
That travel well home

Chorus – SALUTE

Size and Activity
Location, Uniform
Time and Equipment
Keep it cool, keep it warm

No stories, no motive
Just what you can prove
SALUTE keeps it steady
While the whole world moves

Verse 2 – Size

Count the people by the doorway
Count the cars by the curb
If the number isn’t perfect
Say the range you observed

Six to eight, maybe more
Two you couldn’t see
A little honest uncertainty
Goes a long way for me

Chorus – SALUTE

Size and Activity
Location, Uniform
Time and Equipment
Smooth, precise, on form

Say it once, then again
If the picture has changed
SALUTE keeps the signal clean
While the scene rearranges

Verse 3 – Activity

Who’s watching the sidewalk?
Who’s giving the nod?
Who just left and came back again
Like it’s part of the job

Standing still tells a story
So does pacing the lane
Activity speaks volumes
Without calling a name

Verse 4 – Location

“Near the corner” fades quickly
Streets and bearings stay
North wall, third floor, facing east
Ten feet off the way

Landmarks don’t exaggerate
Coordinates don’t lie
Location makes the difference
Between “heard” and “applied”

Chorus – SALUTE (Harmony Lift)

Size and Activity
Location, Uniform
Time and Equipment
Let it land, let it form

No heat, no rush
Just clean execution
SALUTE keeps the record sharp
For the next solution

Verse 5 – Uniform / Unit

Clothes don’t prove alignment
Movement does instead
Matching pace and shared spacing
Say what’s left unsaid

No badge doesn’t mean random
No patch doesn’t mean clean
Uniform’s how a group behaves
Not just what’s seen

Verse 6 – Time & Equipment

When it started, when it shifted
How long it held that shape
Moments keep the order straight
Before memory escapes

Phones and radios and bags
Tools change what comes next
Equipment shows capability
Before anyone connects

Bridge – Easy Truth

SALUTE won’t tell you why
It won’t tell you who to blame
It just keeps the water flat
So analysis can sail

Describe it, don’t diagnose
Observe, don’t accuse
The smoothest reports survive
Because they’re useful

Final Chorus – SALUTE (Full Yacht Rock Shine)

Size and Activity
Location, Uniform
Time and Equipment
Calm, concise, well-worn

No adjectives, no ego
Just facts in motion
SALUTE keeps you floating
On smooth information

Outro – Fade

If it changes, say it again
If you doubt, say so
Truth rides farther
When you let it go
