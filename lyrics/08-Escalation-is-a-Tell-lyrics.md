# Escalation Is a Tell

### Verse 1

It starts with speed you didn't choose
Words that push instead of move
Every second feels compressed
Like the answer has a test

Someone says it can't wait
Says delay is risk or fate
Says the window's closing fast
Like this moment has to last

### Pre-Chorus

If it won't slow
It's not yours

### Chorus

*Escalation is a tell
Pressure rings a quiet bell
If it rushes
If it yells
Escalation is a tell*

*You don't have to match the pace
You don't have to fill the space
When it pushes
That's the sign
Escalation draws the line*

---

### Verse 2

Volume climbs but meaning thins
Sharp edges cut where calm begins
Every word feels set to spark
Every move leaves a mark

Someone frames it now or never
Calls restraint a broken lever
Says the only way is loud
Says the moment needs a crowd

### Pre-Chorus

If it needs force
Let it go

### Chorus

*Escalation is a tell
Pressure rings a quiet bell
If it rushes
If it swells
Escalation is a tell*

*You don't win by going fast
You don't fix what won't hold past
When it tightens
When it pulls
Escalation makes the rules*

---

### Bridge *(drop, half-time)*

Calm keeps choice
Choice keeps you
Speed decides
For someone else

Silence isn't losing ground
It's the space where sense is found

---

### Verse 3

Nothing wrong with stepping back
Nothing owed to keep on track
If the shape begins to break
You don't have to seal the crack

Time reveals what pressure hides
Truth survives the slower side
If it's real it will remain
If it's not it falls away

---

### Final Chorus

*Escalation is a tell
Pressure rings it clear and well
If it hurries
If it sells
Escalation is a tell*

*You don't need to prove or stay
You don't need to push or play
When it presses
That's your cue
Step aside
Let it move*

---

### Outro

**If it can't wait
It can't be right**
