MOSCOW RULES (Modern / Edgy Rewrite)

Verse 1
Assume the camera is on
From the door to where you land
If you wait to spot the watcher
You are already in their hands
Keep your pace and keep your face
Do not rush and do not stall
Normal is your best defense
Nothing special. Nothing at all.

Pre-Chorus
Still hands, steady breath
Attention is the threat

Chorus
Assume you’re seen
Trust the signal in your chest
People break
Plan like every plan will fail
Change your route
Change the hour, change the day
Keep an exit
Walk away

Verse 2
Friendly does not mean safe
Calm does not mean clean
Pressure turns the strongest people
Into places you have seen
Trust is thin and wears out fast
Use it once, then let it go
Never bet the whole direction
On one person saying no

Pre-Chorus
Say less, hold ground
Silence keeps you out

Chorus
Assume you’re seen
Trust the signal in your chest
People break
Plan like every plan will fail
Change your route
Change the hour, change the day
Keep an exit
Walk away

Bridge (Drop instruments, half-time feel)
Do not turn to check behind
Do not prove what you suspect
Act like nothing’s happening
That is how you disconnect
You don’t win by being right
You win by getting clear
Freedom is the quiet space
When no one knows you’re here

Final Chorus (Full instruments back)
Assume you’re seen
Trust the signal in your chest
People break
Plan like every plan will fail
Change your route
Change the hour, change the day
Keep an exit
Walk away

Outro (spoken or sung low)
Blend in.
Break patterns.
Leave clean.
