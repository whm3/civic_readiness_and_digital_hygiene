Say It Slow
 - ThirtySevenFox

Verse 1 — Personal

You don’t owe the room your every thought
Silence isn’t weakness, it’s a knot
Tied tight, keeps your options wide
Once it’s out, it’s out — can’t rewind

Every word’s a door you open wide
You don’t know who’s standing on the other side
You can add another line later on
But you can’t pull a sentence once it’s gone

Pre-Chorus

Take a breath
Feel the space
Let the moment
Set the pace

Chorus

Say it slow
Say just enough
You can always add
But you can’t take it back

Say it clean
Say it light
What you don’t say
Stays yours tonight

You can always say more
You can never say less
So pause before
You cross that edge

Verse 2 — Digital

Every text is permanent ink
Every post is faster than you think
Screenshots live longer than you know
Even when the original goes

Context fades but copies stay
Tone gets lost along the way
You don’t control where words will land
Once they leave your hand

Pre-Chorus

Take the beat
Let it pass
Silence buys you
Time to ask

Chorus

Say it slow
Say just enough
You can always add
But you can’t take it back

Say it clean
Say it light
What you don’t say
Stays yours tonight

You can always say more
You can never say less
So pause before
You cross that edge

Bridge

Not every moment
Needs a reply
Not every truth
Needs your side

Silence isn’t losing ground
It’s the space
Where sense is found

Final Chorus

Say it slow
Hold the line
Words can wait
So can time

Say it clean
Say it light
What you keep
Stays yours tonight

You can always say more
You can never say less
Say it slow
Say it slow

Outro

Some things last
Because they’re kept
