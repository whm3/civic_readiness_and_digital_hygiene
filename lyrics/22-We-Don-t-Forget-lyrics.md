We Don’t Forget (But We Don’t Burn)
   - ThirtySevenFox

Verse 1
Names don’t fade just ‘cause time rolls on
Ink stays dry when the noise is gone
Pictures blur, stories bend
But records wait at the bitter end

You don’t need fire to keep the light
You don’t need fists to prove you’re right
Memory isn’t a shouted threat
It’s a quiet promise we haven’t met

Pre-Chorus
Write it down, keep it straight
Truth is patient, it can wait

Chorus
🎶 We don’t forget — but we don’t burn
We don’t break what we’re here to learn
Justice walks, it doesn’t run
We don’t forget — but we don’t burn 🎶

Verse 2
Anger flashes, then it’s gone
Leaves you standing when the crowd moves on
But names remembered, facts intact
Are heavier than any act

No revenge parade tonight
No shortcut dressed up as right
Accountability takes its time
That’s how truth outlives the crime

Pre-Chorus
Heat fades fast, paper stays
Truth survives the longest days

Chorus
🎶 We don’t forget — but we don’t burn
We don’t trade the future for the hurt
Justice walks, it doesn’t run
We don’t forget — but we don’t burn 🎶

Bridge (half-spoken over horns)
Write the date.
Say the name.
Keep the file.
No delay.

Not to scare.
Not to fight.
Just to make the record right.

Verse 3
Memory’s not a weapon drawn
It’s a light that stays till morning comes
You don’t erase, you don’t erase
You don’t heal by changing place

If you want the world to learn
You don’t torch it just to watch it burn
Truth stands taller when it’s calm
That’s the weight that does real harm

Chorus (Final, Lifted)
🎶 We don’t forget — but we don’t burn
We don’t lose what we’re here to earn
Justice walks, it doesn’t run
We don’t forget — but we don’t burn 🎶

Outro
Names stay said.
Records kept.
That’s the line.
That’s the step.
