Verse 1

Morning light on a paper date
Written small but it carries weight
Shoes by the door keys in hand
Nothing sudden nothing grand

Same steps back to the same place
Same room same neutral face
Time moves slow on a wooden bench
No one’s counting what this costs

Pre-Chorus

This won’t trend
This won’t show
Still you go

Chorus

Court is quiet work
You show up again
You don’t rush
You don’t bend

Court is quiet work
You wait your turn
You bring what’s needed
You don’t burn

No cheers
No sound
Just staying round

Verse 2

Calendar flipped one more page
Another line another stage
Forms filled out names spelled right
Every detail kept tight

Someone drives someone waits
Someone tracks the next date
Nothing heroic on the page
Just keeping things from fraying

Pre-Chorus

This takes time
That’s the point

Chorus

Court is quiet work
You come back through
Same door
Same view

Court is quiet work
You hold the thread
You don’t drop it
Halfway in

No rush
No claim
Just showing the same

Bridge (instrumental drop, minimal)

Patience is a skill
So is memory
So is not letting go
When it gets heavy

Verse 3

Months pass slower than they should
But slower doesn’t mean no good
What stays steady starts to count
Even when it wears you down

If the system moves this way
You move with it day by day
No shortcuts no clean release
Just staying close just staying seen

Final Chorus

Court is quiet work
You stand by
You stay near

Court is quiet work
You keep the line
Clear

No finish
No sign
Just being there
On time

Outro

What lasts
Is what you keep doing
