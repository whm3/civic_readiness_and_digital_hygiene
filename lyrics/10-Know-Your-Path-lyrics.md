Know Your Path
  -ThirtySevenFox
Verse 1

Fifteen here, nothing shared
Same sidewalk, separate air
No circle drawn, no signal shown
Everybody moves alone

Some came early, some came late
Some won’t stay, some won’t wait
Nothing written, nothing planned
Just people where they happen to stand

Pre-Chorus

If it needs a name, it’s gone too far
If it needs a face, you missed the mark

Chorus

Know your path
Hold it clean
Do what fits
Then leave the scene
No command
No one to name
Show up ready
Know your path

Verse 2

Three move when the moment makes sense
Four at most, then it ends
One stays wide, one steps through
One already thinking how to leave the view

Nothing said that needs reply
Nothing promised, nothing tied
If it works, it fades away
If it fails, no one stays

Pre-Chorus

If it needs control, let it go
If it needs explaining, no

Chorus

Know your path
Hold it clean
Do what fits
Then leave the scene
No command
No one to name
Show up ready
Know your path

Bridge (half-time)

No roll call
No sign-in sheet
No “follow me”
On any street

Nothing handed
Nothing kept
What’s done is done
What’s left is left

Verse 3

Some watch edges, some watch time
Some slow things down by staying kind
Some help someone stand upright
Then fade away into the night

Nobody asks who made it work
That’s how you know it did not break
When it’s quiet, when it’s clear
That’s success — nothing here

Final Chorus

Know your path
Nothing more
If it’s done
There’s no encore
You don’t guide
You don’t explain
You act once
Know your path

Outro

When no one knows
Who did what
And nothing points
Back to a spot

That’s the shape
That’s the gain

Know your path.
