Duty to Disobey
   -ThirtySevenFox

Verse 1 – The Weight of the Oath
You raised your hand, you said the words,
To serve the law, not just be heard
The oath you took was not to a face,
But to a code, a higher place
Orders carry power and trust,
But not all commands are just

Chorus
Law above the order, conscience above fear
An unlawful command ends right here
You don’t obey just because it’s said
You answer to the law instead
Law above the order, steady and calm
Right is right, even under command

Verse 2 – What Makes an Order Stand
It must be lawful, clear, and true,
Within authority, meant for you
If it breaks the law or harms the innocent,
It’s not an order—it’s an accident
No rank can legalize a crime,
No pressure makes the wrong thing right

Chorus
Law above the order, read the line
If it crosses it, you don’t comply
Discipline is not blind trust
It’s knowing when refusal is just
Law above the order, plain to see
The law commands you first, not me

Verse 3 – The Duty to Say No
It’s harder still to stand your ground
When everyone else just follows sound
But history shows the cost we pay
When “just obeyed” is the excuse we say
Courage isn’t loud or wild
It’s a quiet no, said disciplined

Chorus
Law above the order, don’t confuse
Silence with strength, or fear with rules
You are responsible for what you do
“I was told” won’t carry you through
Law above the order, hold the line
Your name signs every act as mine

Verse 4 – How to Refuse with Honor
You stay respectful, firm, and clear
You state the reason, not the fear
You seek guidance, document, ask
You don’t escalate, you don’t collapse
Refusal done the lawful way
Is still obedience—to the law you serve each day

Chorus
Law above the order, calm and clean
No drama, no scene
Professional, precise, restrained
That’s how integrity is maintained
Law above the order, understood
Disobedience can be the greater good

Bridge – Accountability Runs Both Ways
Command gives orders, law gives bounds
Responsibility stays on the ground
Following wrong doesn’t shift the blame
You own your actions, name by name

Final Chorus
Law above the order, oath fulfilled
By disciplined thought and measured will
Not every no is disobedience
Some are loyalty in its truest sense
Law above the order, end to end
You serve the law—that’s what you defend

Outro
The uniform carries trust and weight
So choose your actions—don’t abdicate
An unlawful order has no command
The law is the voice you’re sworn to stand
