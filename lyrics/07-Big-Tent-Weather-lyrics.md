Big Tent Weather
  -ThirtySevenFox

Verse 1
Not everyone chants the same
Not every sign says what you say
Different shoes on the same street
Different reasons, same heartbeat

Some came hopeful, some came worn
Some just want a better morning
If you’re hunting flaws to prove
You’ll miss the good we’re trying to move

Pre-Chorus
Agreement isn’t the entry fee
Belonging starts with what we see

Chorus
It’s big tent weather, come on inside
Room for your truth, room for mine
We don’t all match, we don’t all agree
We line up on what’s good to be

Big tent weather, stay awhile
Build the yes before the trial
Broad and steady lasts forever
That’s how we win—big tent weather

Verse 2
Someone whispers, someone sings
Someone fixes broken things
Different tools, a common aim
Less about blame, more about change

If the only bond is who we’re against
The circle shrinks and won’t hold tense
Coalitions last when they’re made
From what we’re for, not who we hate

Pre-Chorus
You don’t need clones to move the ground
You need shared good to gather round

Chorus
It’s big tent weather, side by side
Not one story, not one guide
We don’t all match, we don’t all agree
We line up on what helps us be

Big tent weather, wide and strong
Enough room to carry on
Broad and steady lasts forever
That’s how we win—big tent weather

Bridge (ensemble / call-response)
Not the same—still here
(Not the same—still here)
Different ways—same care
(Different ways—same care)

Name the good you want to grow
That’s the flag we all can hold

Verse 3
History isn’t a single shout
It’s hands building something out
Care, fairness, dignity
Those don’t belong to just one key

Unity isn’t uniform
It’s choosing good in every form
If you want the morning light
You make room through the night

Final Chorus
Big tent weather, clear and kind
We agree on forward time
We don’t all match, we don’t all agree
We stand for what we want to see

Big tent weather, stay together
Movements last when they’re built better
Broad and steady lasts forever
That’s how we win—big tent weather

Outro
Hold the door.
Name the good.
That’s enough
To start with.
