# **The Glomar Answer**

*by ThirtySevenFox*

------

### **Verse 1**

*Corner of the harbor bar*
 *Old charts nailed to the wall*
 You said
 "Let me tell you 'bout
 A ship that took a fall"
 Cold sea over **K-one-two-nine**
 Steel ribs
 A crooked keel
 Down where sunlight never goes
 And secrets never heal

------

### **Chorus**

**Raise a glass to the Glomar answer**
 "I can’t confirm
 I can’t deny"
 To the claw in the dark
 To the bones in the tide
 If you ask who you are
 They just smile and reply
 "I can’t confirm
 I can’t deny"

------

### **Verse 2**

Billionaire’s broken mining rig dream
 Or that’s the cover line
 But we were fishing in the silence
 For a rival’s state of mind
 Giant claw in the midnight depth
 Reaching for a rusted spine
 Metal fingers
 Slipping grip
 On a ghost we’d never find

------

### **Chorus** *(repeat)*

**Raise a glass to the Glomar answer**
 "I can’t confirm
 I can’t deny"
 To the claw in the dark
 To the bones in the tide
 If you ask who you are
 They just smile and reply
 "I can’t confirm
 I can’t deny"

------

### **Verse 3**

Some bodies rose
 Some bodies sank
 Some got folded in a flag
 Some were wrapped in foreign prayers
 Some a numbered canvas bag
 Buried out there where the charts run out
 Where the wake just fades to ink
 We said words over the water
 Then we taught ourselves not to think

------

### **Chorus** *(repeat)*

**Raise a glass to the Glomar answer**
 "I can’t confirm
 I can’t deny"
 To the claw in the dark
 To the bones in the tide
 If you ask who you are
 They just smile and reply
 "I can’t confirm
 I can’t deny"

------

### **Bridge**

So you file that letter
 Ask
 *"What do you know about me?"*
 You think truth comes in a binder
 In a manila sleeve

> *[low vocal register]*
>  But the game is in the answer
>  Not the paper
>  Not the file
>  Just that careful little sentence
>  With a bureaucratic smile

------

### **Chorus** *(repeat)*

**Raise a glass to the Glomar answer**
 "I can’t confirm
 I can’t deny"
 To the claw in the dark
 To the bones in the tide
 If you ask who you are
 They just smile and reply
 "I can’t confirm
 I can’t deny"

------

### **Outro**

Last call at the harbor bar
 Neon buzz
 Cheap gin
 You whisper
 *"Who am I to you?"*
 They just shrug and pull you in

> *[whispered vocals]*
>  "I can’t confirm
>  I can’t deny"
>  Echoes off the salty sky
>  "I can’t confirm
>  I can’t deny"
