# After the Sirens

### Verse 1

Sirens fade like soda fizz
Stickers peeling off the wrists
Street goes quiet, shoes go home
Leftovers in Styrofoam

Phone lights blinking 3 a.m.
Who took notes, who took a lens
Adrenaline in yesterday
Paperwork is on the way

### Pre-Chorus

It doesn't end when the crowd goes dark
It just changes shape, it changes part

### Chorus

*After the sirens, after the cheer
After the chants disappear
The long game starts, slow and plain
Nothing loud, everything remains*

*After the posters hit the floor
After the high wears off for sure
Court dates don't come with a drum
This is where the work gets done*

---

### Verse 2

Cameras are on every side
Metal eyes that never blink
Faces tagged, a passing glance
Turns into a second think

Helicopter hums the tune
Bluetooth ghosts drift through the room
Cellphones tagged and Wifi logged
Smile for nothing, say no names
Data loves a crowded frame

### Pre-Chorus

Attention isn't always praise
Sometimes it follows you for days

### Chorus

*After the sirens, after the cheer
After the chants disappear
The long game starts, slow and plain
Nothing loud, everything remains*

*After the lights, after the wave
After who stayed and who got brave
No applause, no drum
This is where the work gets done*

---

### Bridge *(spoken / half-sung)*

Save the files.
Write it clean.
Names, dates, what you've seen.
Sleep it off, don't hit "send."
Tomorrow's where it really ends.

---

### Verse 3

Unknown numbers after dark
Letters heavy, vaguely marked
"Just a chat," "routine check"
Friendly words with teeth and neck

Pressure dresses business-casual
Smiles that feel procedural
Nothing loud, no scene to see
Just weight applied invisibly
Trying to intimidate me

### Pre-Chorus

You don't argue in the street
You keep it neat, you keep receipts

### Chorus

*After the sirens, after the cheer
After the chants disappear
The long game starts, slow and plain
Nothing loud, everything remains*

*After the street, after the sun
After everyone says "we're done"
No confetti, no drum
This is where the work gets done*

---

### Verse 4

Cold pizza, cold hard facts
Screenshots don't always stack
Names misspelled, times unclear
Memory bends when the rush is near

Everyone's a hero online
Nobody pays the fines
Street is fast, the system's slow
That's just how these stories go

---

### Bridge 2 *(quiet, playful)*

Vinyl crackle, coffee stain
Boring notes beat fleeting fame
Quiet beats a flash like this
Patience is a kind of fist

---

### Final Chorus

*After the sirens, after the cheer
After the chants disappear
The long game starts, slow and plain
Nothing loud, everything remains*

*After the noise, after the run
After attention picks someone
No spotlight, no drum
This is where the work gets done*

---

### Outro

Street goes quiet.
Records stay.
**What you do tomorrow
Counts as much as today.**
