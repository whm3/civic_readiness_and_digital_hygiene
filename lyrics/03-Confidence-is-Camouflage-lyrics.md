### Verse 1 — The First Rule

You don't hunt like a hunter
You don't stalk like a cat
You move like the sidewalk
Like the world's where you're at

No sharp eyes, no stiff spine
No rhythm out of time
If you look like you're working
Then you're already behind

### Chorus — The Hook

*Walk like you belong
Like you've always been here
Confidence is camouflage
When there's nothing to fear*

*Don't repeat, don't rush
Let the moment lead
You don't follow a person
You follow the need*

---

### Verse 2 — The Team

No one owns the shadow
No one holds the line
You pass the thread gently
Like a stitch through time

Three or four is plenty
If no one plays the star
You're not a chain or a pack
You're just where people are

One fades, one drifts
One waits, one goes
No signals worth seeing
No leader that shows

---

### Verse 3 — Speaking Without Talking

You don't flood the channel
You don't tell the tale
The quieter the message
The more it will sail

A nod can say "steady"
A pause can say "stay"
Most messages are timing
Not the words you say

One click on the radio
Just says "I'm here"
Two clicks say "I hear you"
Nothing to overhear

Three clicks mark the moment
Not the reason why
Signals without secrets
Let the silence reply

No plans, no purpose
No story to defend
You speak in acknowledgments
And let the quiet send

### Chorus — Variation

*Walk like you belong
Like there's nowhere else to be
The city hides the careful
Not the sharp or the free*

*Say less, mean more
Let quiet do its part
Good teams speak in patterns
Not noise or clever art*

---

### Verse 4 — Roles

One keeps the wheels honest
Eyes fixed on the way
Motion stays natural
Just another day

The other remembers the faces
Who lingers, who leaves
What they do with their time
And who they go on to meet

Hands have their purpose
Minds have their lane
When focus is divided
Nothing pulls at the chain

---

### Verse 5 — Mounted and Moving

Wheels don't chase the rabbit
They flow with the stream
Traffic forgives the patient
And punishes the keen

Stops come naturally
Turns don't shout
You never chase what's leaving
You let it come back out

A car's just a reason
To be in the lane
You don't win by being close
You win by being plain

---

### Verse 6 — Watching While Watching

While you're tracing another
You check the wider frame
Who holds too long behind you
Who mirrors pace or lane

The watcher who forgets this
Is already late
Awareness runs in circles
Not a one-way state

If eyes feel like they linger
If patterns overlap
You don't fix it with action
You loosen the map

---

### Verse 7 — Cover and Concealment

Cover's what explains you
Concealment's what you keep
A reason buys forgiveness
Silence buys you sleep

Coffee cups and windows
Benches, doors, and light
Normal is the blanket
That hides you best at night

Never borrow drama
Never make a scene
Nothing draws attention
Like trying not to be seen

---

### Verse 8 — Memory

You don't write it while it's living
You don't mark it while it breathes
You carry it behind the eyes
Where nothing can be seized

Commit it to your memory
Let patterns settle slow
Details sharpen after
When you're clear of the flow

Write it down when it's over
When the moment's released
No evidence, no proof
No reason held or leased

---

### Bridge — The Quiet Truth

*Every word has weight
Every mark has cost
What you never capture
Can never be lost*

*Distance keeps the story true
Proximity tells lies
You succeed when the world forgets
You were ever nearby*

---

### Verse 9 — Rotation and Restraint

Familiar is a warning
Patterns ring the bell
If you feel remembered
You've stayed a beat too well

Change faces, change reasons
Change pace, not goal
The best handoff happens
When no one feels the role

No echo, no shadow
No steps that align
The cleanest follow ends
Before anyone minds

---

### Final Chorus — Full Reprise

*Walk like you belong
Like the street knows your name
Confidence is camouflage
When you don't play the game*

*Don't repeat, don't rush
Let the city lead
You don't follow a person
You follow the need*

---

### Outro — The Lesson

The best work leaves no memory
Outside of the mind
No story, no artifact
No thread left behind

You weren't a shadow
You weren't a sign
You were part of the weather
And the weather was fine

So walk like you belong
And when it's time to end
You disappear the same way
You came in.
