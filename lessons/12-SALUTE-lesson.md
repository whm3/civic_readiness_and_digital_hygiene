# Lesson Detail — SALUTE

| | |
|---|---|
| **Module** | 3 — Observation, Documentation & Information Discipline |
| **Track Type** | Core doctrine (objective reporting, situational awareness, information hygiene) |
| **Duration** | One listen (repeatable) |
| **Audience** | Observers, documentarians, marshals, planners, analysts, support roles |

## Lesson Purpose

To teach objective observation and reporting using a standardized, non-interpretive framework that preserves accuracy, credibility, and usefulness over time.

This lesson establishes that good information survives pressure when it is:
- Factual
- Structured
- Calm
- Repeatable

SALUTE provides a shared language for describing what is happening without diagnosing intent, assigning blame, or escalating tone.

## Core Doctrine

> Describe it. Don't diagnose it.

**Information remains usable when:**
- Facts are separated from conclusions
- Uncertainty is acknowledged
- Observations are time-bound
- Emotion is excluded

**Information fails when:**
- Motives are assumed
- Adjectives replace measurements
- Urgency distorts reporting
- Ego enters the record

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, participants should be able to:

1. Observe environments without projecting meaning
2. Report changes using a consistent structure
3. Communicate uncertainty honestly
4. Avoid speculation, accusation, or narrative framing
5. Update information cleanly when conditions change
6. Understand why neutral reporting protects everyone

## The SALUTE Framework

SALUTE is a descriptive checklist, not an analysis tool.

| Letter | Element | Focus |
|--------|---------|-------|
| **S** | Size | How many? |
| **A** | Activity | What are they doing? |
| **L** | Location | Where exactly? |
| **U** | Uniform/Unit | How are they behaving as a group? |
| **T** | Time | When did this happen? |
| **E** | Equipment | What do they have? |

> SALUTE answers "What is happening?", not "Why?"

## Key Concepts (Plain Language)

### 1. Size — Count, Don't Guess

**Report:**
- Visible numbers
- Ranges if uncertain
- What you could not see

**Acceptable:**
- "Six to eight"
- "Two obscured"

**Avoid:**
- Precision you don't have
- Assumptions about absence

> Honest uncertainty is more valuable than false accuracy.

### 2. Activity — Motion Tells the Story

**Observe:**
- Movement patterns
- Pacing
- Entry and exit behavior
- Repetition

Activity communicates function, not motive.

> Standing still and pacing both mean something — neither needs interpretation.

### 3. Location — Anchors Matter

**Use:**
- Fixed landmarks
- Directions or bearings
- Floors, corners, distances

**Avoid:**
- Vague references
- Emotional descriptors

> Location turns observation into usable information.

### 4. Uniform / Unit — Behavior Over Appearance

Uniform does not mean clothing alone.

**Observe:**
- Shared pacing
- Spacing
- Coordinated movement
- Consistent behavior

**Avoid:**
- Assumptions based on attire
- Identity inference

> A unit is how people move, not how they dress.

### 5. Time — Sequence Preserves Meaning

**Record:**
- Start
- Change
- Duration

**Time prevents:**
- Memory drift
- Narrative creep
- Hindsight bias

> Moments fade faster than facts.

### 6. Equipment — Capability Without Judgment

**Note:**
- Tools present
- Visible gear
- Changes in equipment

**Avoid:**
- Speculation about intent
- Assumptions about use

> Equipment describes capacity, not purpose.

## Reporting Discipline

### Say Only What You Know

**Good reporting:**
- Avoids adjectives
- Excludes emotion
- Survives retelling

**Bad reporting:**
- Diagnoses
- Assigns blame
- Escalates tone

> If you wouldn't testify to it, don't record it.

### Update Without Apology

When conditions change:
- Restate SALUTE
- Note what changed
- Do not explain why

> If it changes, say it again.

### Silence Is Allowed

If you are unsure:
- Say so
- Pause
- Wait

> Truth travels farther when you let it go.

## Teaching Notes (Facilitator)

- Emphasize calm over completeness
- Normalize stating uncertainty
- Reinforce that SALUTE is not surveillance — it is situational awareness
- Avoid "intel" or adversarial framing

This lesson works best when framed as:

> "Clean facts make clean decisions."

## Common Misconceptions to Address

- "We need to explain what it means"
- "We should infer intent"
- "Emotion makes it clearer"
- "If I don't know why, I shouldn't report"

**Reframe gently:** Description is enough.

## Indicators of Understanding

A participant understands the lesson when they can say:

- "I report what I see, not what I think."
- "I'm allowed to say I don't know."
- "I update facts without adding story."
- "My report stays useful tomorrow."

## Relationship to Other Tracks

| Track | Connection |
|-------|------------|
| Say It Slow | Restraint and timing |
| Escalation Is a Tell | Pressure recognition |
| When It's Needed | Functional roles |
| Carry the Signal | Message clarity |

This track anchors the curriculum's observation and documentation doctrine.

## One-Sentence Summary (Memory Hook)

> **Describe it clean. Let others decide.**
