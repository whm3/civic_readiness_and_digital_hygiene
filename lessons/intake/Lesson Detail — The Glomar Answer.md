## Lesson Purpose

To train participants to **use FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) requests** as a self-surveillance audit mechanism — not to ask permission, but to detect interest.

This lesson emphasizes that the **Glomar response** (“we can neither confirm nor deny…”) is a **canary**: it doesn’t block you — it warns you.

------

## Core Doctrine

> **Glomar is not the end of the conversation. It is the signal to start watching.**

You FOIA yourself regularly to:

- Detect if you’ve become an “object of interest”
- Document a timeline of surveillance or targeting
- Test visibility inside institutional systems
- Train others in awareness and self-advocacy

A Glomar reply isn’t silence. It’s **an institutional flinch**.

------

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, participants should be able to:

1. Understand the origin and meaning of the Glomar response
2. Explain Project Azorian and the K-129 incident as historical context
3. Use FOIA to query their own surveillance footprint
4. Recognize a Glomar response as a **bureaucratic canary**
5. Establish a **cadence of inquiry** (e.g. every 6 months)
6. Know what to do if the answer changes

------

## Key Concepts (Plain Language)

### 1. What Is the Glomar Response?

> **“We can neither confirm nor deny the existence of records…”**

Coined by the CIA in the 1970s, this phrase allows government agencies to:

- Avoid admitting surveillance
- Avoid denying it
- Maintain operational secrecy without revealing anything

> When they won’t even say “no,” you’ve triggered a threshold.

------

### 2. Project Azorian & K-129 (Historical Context)

In 1968, the Soviet submarine **K-129** sank in the Pacific under mysterious conditions. The U.S. located the wreck and launched **Project Azorian** — a covert CIA operation to recover it using a massive ship built under the cover story of "deep-sea mining": the **Glomar Explorer**.

While some parts of the sub were recovered, others (including crew remains) were lost or reburied at sea. The operation was a Cold War intelligence coup — and a secrecy milestone.

When journalists tried to FOIA records about the Glomar Explorer, the CIA invented a new type of non-answer:

> *“We can neither confirm nor deny…”*

This phrase became legal doctrine — and cultural code.

------

### 3. FOIA as a Canary

You can FOIA:

- The FBI, DHS, NSA, CIA, and more
- For files referencing you
- For indicators of interest, surveillance, or targeting

> If you get “no responsive records,” that’s good.
>  If you get a **Glomar**, that’s a flag.
>  If you get **redacted records**, that’s confirmation.

------

### 4. Regular Cadence = Counterintelligence Hygiene

Set a FOIA schedule:

- Every 6 months
- Use templates (or privacy org tools)
- Track responses over time

Glomar today but full records a year from now? That’s a pattern.

> Think of it as checking your digital credit report — but for federal scrutiny.

------

### 5. Don’t Panic — Document

A Glomar doesn’t mean “you’re screwed.”
 It means **you’re worth watching**, and now **you know that**.

Use this to:

- Adjust your risk posture
- Secure your communications
- Inform your network
- Monitor escalation

> Canary sings, monkey listens.

## Teaching Notes (Facilitator)

- Provide sample FOIA templates for “myself as subject”
- Normalize inquiry: “checking is not paranoia, it’s protocol”
- Validate emotions without dramatizing
- Emphasize **empowerment through awareness**, not fear

------

## Common Misconceptions to Address

- “If they won’t tell me, I must be safe.”
- “If I’m not doing anything wrong, I won’t be watched.”
- “I’ll get in trouble for asking.”

> Reframe: **Silence is strategy. Questions are tools.**

------

## Indicators of Understanding

Participants can say:

- “FOIA is part of my operational routine.”
- “A Glomar isn’t silence — it’s alert status yellow.”
- “They didn’t say no. That *is* the answer.”
- “My next request is already scheduled.”

| Track                | Connection                                   |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Save the Original    | Building your own archive of records         |
| Say It Slow          | Strategic inquiry timing                     |
| Escalation Is a Tell | Recognizing signs of institutional awareness |
| Posture Check        | Aligning behavior with level of exposure     |

## One-Sentence Summary (Memory Hook)

> **FOIA yourself like checking your credit report. If they Glomar you, pay attention.**
