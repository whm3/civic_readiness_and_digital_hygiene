# Lesson Detail — Save the Original

| | |
|---|---|
| **Module** | 4 — Rights, Law & Ethical Boundaries |
| **Track Type** | Evidence discipline & digital restraint |
| **Duration** | One listen (repeatable) |
| **Audience** | General public, demonstrators, observers, journalists, legal monitors, educators |

## Lesson Purpose

To teach evidence discipline in a digital environment, emphasizing why original records matter more than viral posts, and why restraint protects credibility, safety, and legal outcomes.

This lesson reinforces a core boundary:

> **Truth survives when it is preserved, not performed.**

## Legal & Civic Context

Modern civic life generates enormous amounts of digital evidence—video clips, photos, messages, and posts. While sharing feels immediate and validating, legal systems value integrity over visibility.

**Courts, investigators, journalists, and accountability processes rely on:**
- Original files
- Intact metadata
- Clear timelines
- Unaltered context

**Edits, reposts, screenshots, and commentary may:**
- Strip metadata
- Distort timing
- Remove context
- Weaken credibility

> Screens amplify noise. Records preserve facts.

## Core Doctrine

> Save first. Share later — or not at all.

## Learning Objectives

Participants will be able to:

1. Understand the difference between posts and records
2. Explain why original files carry legal weight
3. Recognize how edits and reposts weaken evidence
4. Practice restraint after high-stress events
5. Preserve evidence without escalating or oversharing

## Key Concepts (Plain Language)

### 1. Originals Carry Weight

**Original files include:**
- Full video or photo data
- Timestamps
- Device metadata
- Sequence and duration

**Screenshots and clips:**
- Remove context
- Hide timing
- Invite misinterpretation

> What feels "clean" online may be unusable later.

### 2. Context Is Part of the Evidence

**Short clips:**
- Exaggerate moments
- Remove lead-up and aftermath
- Distort meaning

**Legal and ethical review asks:**
- What happened before?
- What happened after?
- Who was present?

> Context is not commentary — it's structure.

### 3. Clouds Are Not Neutral

**Automatic syncing can:**
- Create uncontrolled copies
- Spread files beyond intent
- Expose data through breaches or subpoenas

**Preservation means:**
- Knowing where copies exist
- Limiting access
- Avoiding unnecessary distribution

> Copies persist long after attention fades.

### 4. Silence Is a Protective Act

**Immediate posting:**
- Locks in narratives
- Invites misreading
- Escalates conflict

**Waiting allows:**
- Clarity
- Accuracy
- Safer decisions

> Silence is not surrender. It's patience.

### 5. Metadata Speaks Louder Than Captions

**What courts value:**
- Date and time
- Location data
- Device continuity

**What captions add:**
- Opinion
- Risk
- Confusion

> Let the file speak for itself.

### 6. You Don't Owe the Feed Your Proof

**Public platforms reward:**
- Speed
- Outrage
- Certainty

**Justice systems reward:**
- Accuracy
- Completeness
- Restraint

> The long game favors those who keep clean records.

### 7. Preservation Is an Ethical Choice

**Saving originals:**
- Protects the truth
- Protects others
- Protects yourself

**Editing or oversharing:**
- Contaminates evidence
- Endangers people
- Weakens outcomes

## Practical Guidance

### Do:
- Save original files immediately
- Preserve filenames, dates, and sequences
- Store securely and redundantly
- Wait before sharing or commenting

### Don't:
- Edit or crop originals
- Post while tired or emotional
- Add commentary to evidence
- Assume platforms are temporary

## Common Misconceptions

- "Posting helps accountability" → **Sometimes, but not always**
- "Screenshots are enough" → **Often false**
- "Clouds are safe by default" → **False**
- "Silence looks guilty" → **False**

## Indicators of Understanding

A participant understands this lesson when they can say:

- "Original files matter more than posts."
- "Metadata is part of the evidence."
- "Waiting protects outcomes."
- "I don't owe the internet everything I record."

| Say It Slow | Restraint before speaking |
| SALUTE | Neutral observation |
| Am I Detained or Am I Free? | Legal self-protection |

## One-Sentence Summary (Memory Hook)

> **Posts disappear. Records persist. Save the original.**
